# WELCOME DEAR DEVELOPER...  :smile: :smile:
![Hello](https://media.tenor.com/images/19aba5fb5a891041880efd7efb64017f/tenor.gif)


First things first you need to contribute to this repository because this repository help developers with plugins or with jobs(super important if you want to get some fresh cash)

## Some things we need for the project :heavy_check_mark:
We need a lot of code.Actual code is a little bit poor (but no matter we will grow as fast as a soda with mento's)what we need for example:
* **Fancy web page**, because actual is responsive but also ugly.
* **Some backend code**, to manage tickets for app.
* **More backend code**, for cover how developers will get paid.
* **More and More backend code**, for modify developers and user profile.
* **And the most important thing a lot of...tons of backend code**, for protect us against malicious attacks.

### Documentation
![DOC](https://francis.naukas.com/files/2015/05/Dibujo20150529-why-most-published-results-may-be-false-tbbt-cbs-sit-com.gif)


So, code documentantion is also important for us ,because we don't like spaghetti code ,so, some rules are nedeed to cover this:
* **Only tabs are valid**.
* **Only this type of if is valid**.
```javascript
if(true)
{
  //Code
  console.log("Keep reading the file ;)");
}
```
* **Always try to optimize code before pull because of performance**.
* **You can keep console.log() functions if you like**.
* **For the god of love write good comments for your code**.


If you didn't pass this rules then well...

### Pull Request's :fire:
* Before make a pull to the repository, you must clone this repository in your local machine and **try if it works**.

If it works, great a new developer contributed, if not then, try more ```console.log()``` in your file.
* The last thing to do it is that if all works properly with no crashes or null references or something like that, then run the following command
```npm run-script format``` and pull it!.

If you reached the end of the file and you accomplished all tasks then pull it and feel like thanos :+1: :relieved: :relieved:
